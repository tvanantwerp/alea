        <h1>Alea Password Generator</h1>
        <p>Alea is a simple password generator based on selecting several words at random which are easy to memorize but hard to guess.</p>
        <p>Alea uses JavaScript to select words from a large list to create your random password. This generator is a proof of concept. A skilled adversary could compromise this generator, so you should not totally trust your results.</p>
